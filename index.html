It is reported that some people have been killed in building collapses, in a town near the epicenter.

I'm also seeing reports that Bifengxia has suffered some minor damage, but all staff and pandas are well. Reports say that the pandas were scared during the earthquake and after shocks, but have now gone back to their normal routines.

I'm also told that the road between BFX and Ya'an the closest city has been damaged, and staff are having to walk.

I will update again if I hear anymore.
